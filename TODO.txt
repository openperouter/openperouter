vtepip vs vtep prefix under frr. Also, ipv6

node selector
ip assignement: vtep, veths

status
ipam: current mechanism is fragile
manual assign: a per VRF per node CRD. Also, vtep per node manual


add context to the reloaedr logic

bgp passwords

ipam count validation

reconciliation with link subscribe: if somebody touches the interfaces, we should reconcile
merge configurations
default values

propagate the request in http post via context
idempotent configurations

conversion unit tests

in e2e: what happens if the pod dies when eth1 is inside of it? It gets deleted. Solution: recreate the veth
todo: when moving nic in namespace, we check only if it exists but we don't check if it has the right ip. Save it so we can reuse


mess with cidr / ip vtep ip

generate different mac addresses for bridges

same ip for all veth legs on the host

redistribute connected as option in each vni?
distroless image

get rid of all the + "/32" around the codebase and better define cidrs vs addresses

We are advertising the veth host ip to the host itself

Add a status on VNI with the local ip / a way to use it from outside.

Remove the VRF field and use the name of the VNI / autogenerate it
Add a label to the node so the node index is sticky, or even better, use the annotation to express the VTEP / VNI cidr

Destroy the frr pod if somebody tries to change the underlay interface.
